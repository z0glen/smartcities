    <p>One big concern about trusting large corporations with huge amounts of
    data is that one vulnerability can release all of this data into the public
    sphere, such that anyone can have access to it. This would mean that anyone
     would be able to see things like where you spent your time, where you’ve
     travelled, how you’ve travelled there and how long it took, what you like,
     your height and weight. Many things that you don’t necessarily want the
     world to know about you, particularly things like where you live.</p>

     <p>Making this fear even more real is that these companies profit from
     targeted advertising, meaning taking this data about you and using to to
     sell you things. Search for cats a couple of times and you’ll get ads for
     cat litter and cat food. Frequent one specific coffee shop and you’ll
     <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/22/facebook-ads-physical-stores/">see ads for it</a>.
     Big companies know what interests you, and what you’re likely
     to spend money on. That alone is a concerning prospect, but taking it one
     step further, the evolution of smart cities means that companies will have
     access to even more information, and even more clever targeted advertising
     techniques.</p>

     <p>One such technique that has already begun to surface is
     <a href="https://www.campaignlive.com/article/future-smart-billboards/1422247">dynamic billboards</a>,
     or billboards that interact and change based on the people
     viewing them. Such ads use facial recognition to determine basic information
     about the viewer, like gender and age, and display different content based
     on those results, from a range of predetermined options.</p>

     <p>While the current forms do not store data or utilize existing data from companies,  it is not
     difficult to foresee a future where billboards can link a face to a social
     media account and display completely customized ads based on the specific
     viewer. This could also act as another source of data collection, to monitor
     who is travelling in which direction past the billboard. Besides the obvious
     implication of companies having too much information about users, this kind
     of technology could allow companies to collect data on people who are not
     users and are simply passing by. It would also limit the content that we
     experience to things that we are already familiar with, thus limiting the
     bubble of content that we are exposed to. Seeing the same ads over and over
     is tiring, but it’s also a little bit constricting, as it offers fewer
     opportunities to experience new and different things.</p>

        <p>The foundation of a city is its transportation network, including roads,
        trains, and buses. These networks are universally targeted across most
        major cities as areas of improvement by ‘smart’ technologies. Mainly,
        road congestion can be decreased by analyzing traffic flow and looking
        for patterns in congestion, which can then be addressed. There are also
        emerging solutions for automating this process, where traffic lights will
        automatically adjust themselves based on congestion in the intersection.
        This also allows adjacent lights to sync, such that the average car would
        hit fewer red lights on their route.</p>

        <p>In a similar vein, there are systems that allow for communication with traffic
        lights between emergency services and public transport vehicles, like buses
        and trams. This allows lights to change to allow traffic to flow through such
        that ambulances and buses will be able to move through the intersection quickly,
        which could help ambulances respond to calls faster and for buses to get people
        to their destinations quicker. This is particularly effective when coupled with
        bus/emergency vehicle lanes. There is a similar solution in which intersection
        cameras can detect bikes and pedestrians at an intersection, and give them priority,
        allowing them to pass through intersections more quickly.</p>

    	<p>Moving to public transportation networks in a broader sense, there are technologies
        deployed in cities to help manage the flow of passengers through the network.
        Similar to technologies for intersections, camera can be placed at stops and
        in stations to monitor how many people are waiting for a particular route,
        and can adjust routes based on that information. For example, if there are
        a lot of people waiting on one line, the system can automatically add more
        trains or buses. If there are a lot of people at one particular stop, the
        system can send trains or buses directly to that stop, bypassing prior stops.
        This technology can be coupled with road technology for buses, so that if there
        is an accident along a bus route, all buses will be rerouted around it to make better time.</p>

    	<p>Looking even further ahead, the advent of self driving cars will allow for
        more customized door to door transport. Similar to current ride sharing services,
        self driving cars can be used to request a ride to a particular destination,
        and would provide door to door service. However, self driving car technology
        would be cheaper for consumers, and allow for significantly more optimization
        of traffic flow, as cars would be redirected if there is traffic,
        and intersections can be more precisely timed.</p>

        <h2>Boston Today</h2>

        <p>Boston is a historic city, rooted in a spirit of pioneering, and home
        to some of the nation's oldest institutions. In other words, Boston is
        an old city, with the infrastructure to show for it. The roads are an
        endless tangle of curves and one-ways, the highways are well over capacity
        and don’t serve enough of the city, and the trains are poorly planned and
        in desperate need of repair. Congestion in Boston is bad, just ask any
        driver who commutes in from the suburbs. In 2016, the average Boston
        driver spent about
        <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/03/25/not-your-imagination-your-boston-commute-getting-worse/J7SdMk5wwwLa3oQWplqGHN/story.html">60 hours</a>
         in rush hour traffic, and Boston was rated the
        <a href="http://inrix.com/resources/inrix-2016-global-traffic-scorecard/">16th most congested city</a>
         in the world. To compound problems, ride
        sharing services have increased traffic on the roads, particularly on
        weekends and nights, while public transit usage during rush hour has been
        <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/11/10/declining-ridership-why-and-where/KqeVpQluiuY5jWdb9DzmlI/story.html">increasing</a>.
        As infuriating as the T can be, a lot of Bostonians depend on
        it to get to work. It’s
        <a href="http://www.apta.com/resources/statistics/Pages/ridershipreport.aspx">the fourth busiest subway system and the busiest light rail system</a>
         in the nation, which is an impressive feat for such
        a small city.</p>

        <p>Boston has taken on some
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig">ambitious roadway projects</a>
         in the past,
        but the result is largely unchanged. Most ideas for improving traffic are
        highly invasive, expensive, and likely ineffective. Some advocates are
        pushing for
        <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2017/05/22/how-improve-boston-infrastructure-future/Jd6CezHFiPiivRtE8sHl5H/story.html">more aggressive measures</a>
         to push commuters onto the T, but
        the T is already overcapacity during peak commuting times, and increasing
        fees is often a difficult sell politically. Luckily for Boston, there may
        be some answers in the new high tech, big data world of the ‘Smart City’.</p>

        <h2>Current Smart City Initiatives</h2>

        <h3><a href="https://www.boston.gov/innovation-and-technology/smart-streets">Smart Streets</a></h3>
        <p>Installing cameras and sensors around the
        Mass Ave and Beacon St intersection to observe how vehicles, bikes, and
        pedestrians move through the intersection. The goal is to test a variety
        of sensors, and to examine how people move through the intersection to
        identify ways to make the intersection safer and more efficient.</p>

        <h3><a href="http://www.bostonplans.org/planning/planning-initiatives/boston-smart-utilities-project">Smart Utilities</a></h3>
        <p>Initiative by the Boston Planning and Development Agency to create an
        integrated utility planning framework. The goal is to reduce street closings
        for utility work by establishing a forum for utility companies to coordinate
        construction projects.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/new-urban-mechanics">Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics</a></h3>
        <p>A city hall coordinated effort to pilot various experiments in new,
        smart technologies. They are coordinating projects such as ‘LED Street Signs’,
        ‘Smart Streets’, ‘Smart Parking’, and a whole host of other projects.</p>

        <p>Another effort by the New Urban Mechanics, Boston is taking a graduated
        and conservative approach to autonomous vehicles, with the overall goal of
        reducing accidents and enabling those with impaired vision or limited transit
        access more options for getting around. There are currently three private
        companies approved for on-street testing along the South Boston waterfront.</p>

    "text":"""
        <p>The Smart City is still a very abstract concept- there is no clear
        or consistent definition of what a Smart City is, it’s just any city that
        utilizes new data collection and analysis methods. Many existing cities use
        some components of these technologies, but what sets a city apart as a
        Smart City is when they’re on the leading edge of the technology. They’re
        spearheading new tests and utilizing every new technology that comes along.
        Such is the case of Singapore, the Southeast Asian island nation vying to
        be the smartest city in the world.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/03/singapore-smart-nation-smart-city/">Singapore</a>
        has been a hotbed of Smart City testing, as it’s government
        has taken a very serious approach to spearheading technological innovation
        in nearly every aspect of daily life. It’s roads are open to self-driving
        cars, taxis, and shuttles, with full scale self-driving buses coming soon.
        It uses sensors to track where passengers are waiting for buses, which
        allows the city to dispatch more buses on more crowded routes, which
        reduces overcrowding and wait times. In terms of private transit,
        Singapore has been using extensive electronic tolling to try to reduce
        cars on the road, and is currently developing a comprehensive system to
        monitor every single vehicle on the road via government mandated satellite
        navigation systems. This will result in one map containing every car on
        the road, from which they can detect congestion and accidents, and can
        better plan traffic management strategies. As part of this same system,
        parking and tolling will be automatic, as the government knows where you
        drove and where you parked.</p>

        <p>The
        <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/16/alphabet-google-sidewalk-labs-toronto-quayside/">Sidewalk Labs initiative in Toronto</a>
        is a somewhat different approach
        to a Smart City. Essentially, the city of Toronto identified about 750 acres
        of underutilized, industrial area where they want to test new Smart City
        technology for viability. They opened bids to private companies, and ended
        up selecting one from Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet. In terms of
        transportation, the biggest concept is completely closing most of the
        neighborhood to car travel, instead converting roads into pedestrian and
        cyclist throughways, with some roads for public transit and emergency vehicles.
        This would eliminate the need for parking in most of the neighborhood,
        freeing up additional space for residents and businesses. They are also
        working on a system of cameras to monitor the movement of people around the
        neighborhood, mostly to get a better understanding of how people interact
        with their environment, and to better plan mobility. It’s not quite a
        clean slate, but it is an interesting chance to experiment with how modern
        urban planning intersects with big data in the context of a thriving city.</p>

    <h2>Future Directions</h2>

    <h3>Automate the T</h3>
    <p>This is very common overseas and in some newer, smaller systems in the states,
    but hasn’t really even been considered in larger systems like Boston. Though
    there have been some ideas floating around, like placing the tape markers at
    Downtown Crossing where the train doors will be, there is really very little
    development being done on automating the T.</p>

    <h3>Dynamic Transit</h3>
    <p>Upgrading data collection to better monitor waiting passengers, and learn
    to anticipate transit needs. Dispatch additional trains when there are more
    passengers waiting, and target trains based on where people are going. Similarly,
    remapping transit routes based on more updated data.</p>

    <h3>Dynamic Traffic Lights</h3>
    <p>Synchronize with each other and constantly adjust timing to allow based on
    signal inputs to make intersections more efficient. Can also be used to give
    trains, buses, bikes, pedestrians, and/or emergency vehicles priorities on the road.</p>

    <h3>Vehicle to Vehicle Communication</h3>
    <p>Vehicles communication with each other and with traffic lights, to optimize
    road conditions in real time based on where people are going.</p>

    <h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
    <p>While this project has been started, it’s been a slow process. Once it
    gains traction, there will be way more opportunity for traffic flow optimization
    and real-time mapping of traffic conditions.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://transitmatters.org/regional-rail">Regional Rail</a></h3>
    <p>Based on a recent report by a nonprofit transit advocacy group, the idea of
    regional rail over the commuter rail clearly has a number of benefits to greater
    Boston. Essentially, it boils down to a few key changes in the commuter rail
    system: electrifying the tracks, decreasing turnaround time, increasing service
    frequency, elevating all boarding platforms, and building the North-South rail
    link. This will certainly require a hefty upfront cost, but would address some
    of the chief complaints about the commuter rail, including infrequent service,
    high cost, and noise, as well as the environmental and logistical concern of
    using diesel trains.</p>

    <h3>Adaptive Tolling and HOV Lanes</h3>
    <p>One major point in reducing traffic is encouraging would-be drivers to use
    public transit or to carpool. The typical mechanisms for this include expanded
    electronic tolling on all major arteries, to increase the cost of driving during
    peak traffic. Many cities also utilize HOV lanes, which allow carpoolers to
    bypass traffic. Tolling in HOV lanes can vary. Sometimes it is less expensive,
    sometimes it is more expensive, depending on the needs of the city.</p>

    <h2>Drawbacks and Challenges</h2>

    <h3>Cost and Permanence</h3>
    <p>Many of these technologies require significant upfront investment, or would
    be difficult to change after the fact, should the cities needs change. A careful
    and deliberate approach must be taken to ensure that any investments made are
    done in a way that is well thought out and coordinated.</p>

    <h3>Privacy</h3>
    <p>Many people are weary of having more cameras around, and for such important
    decisions to be removed from human control. Any data that is collected should be
    thoroughly anonymous and carefully stored, if at all. There should be clear pathways
    to handle complaints and to manually make improvements.</p>

    <h3>Targeted Advertising and Privatization</h3>
    <p>With such large scale data collection and analysis, it is important that the
    individual remains anonymous, and that all data is thoroughly protected. It is
    also important that data is not unfairly benefiting businesses, such that they
    are able to use the data for targeted advertising, as is becoming
    <a href="{{ url_for('advertising') }}">somewhat of a trend</a>.</p>
