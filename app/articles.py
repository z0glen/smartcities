    One big concern about trusting large corporations with huge amounts of
    data is that one vulnerability can release all of this data into the public
    sphere, such that anyone can have access to it. This would mean that anyone
     would be able to see things like where you spent your time, where you’ve
     travelled, how you’ve travelled there and how long it took, what you like,
     your height and weight. Many things that you don’t necessarily want the
     world to know about you, particularly things like where you live.
     Making this fear even more real is that these companies profit from
     targeted advertising, meaning taking this data about you and using to to
     sell you things. Search for cats a couple of times and you’ll get ads for
     cat litter and cat food. Frequent one specific coffee shop and you’ll see
     ads for it. Big companies know what interests you, and what you’re likely
     to spend money on. That alone is a concerning prospect, but taking it one
     step further, the evolution of smart cities means that companies will have
     access to even more information, and even more clever targeted advertising
     techniques. One such technique that has already begun to surface is dynamic
     billboards, or billboards that interact and change based on the people
     viewing them. Such ads use facial recognition to determine basic information
     about the viewer, like gender and age, and display different content based
     on those results, from a range of predetermined options. While the current
     forms do not store data or utilize existing data from companies,  it is not
     difficult to foresee a future where billboards can link a face to a social
     media account and display completely customized ads based on the specific
     viewer. This could also act as another source of data collection, to monitor
     who is travelling in which direction past the billboard. Besides the obvious
     implication of companies having too much information about users, this kind
     of technology could allow companies to collect data on people who are not
     users and are simply passing by. It would also limit the content that we
     experience to things that we are already familiar with, thus limiting the
     bubble of content that we are exposed to. Seeing the same ads over and over
     is tiring, but it’s also a little bit constricting, as it offers fewer
     opportunities to experience new and different things.

        The foundation of a city is its transportation network, including roads,
        trains, and buses. These networks are universally targeted across most
        major cities as areas of improvement by ‘smart’ technologies. Mainly,
        road congestion can be decreased by analyzing traffic flow and looking
        for patterns in congestion, which can then be addressed. There are also
        emerging solutions for automating this process, where traffic lights will
        automatically adjust themselves based on congestion in the intersection.
        This also allows adjacent lights to sync, such that the average car would
        hit fewer red lights on their route.
	In a similar vein, there are systems that allow for communication with traffic
    lights between emergency services and public transport vehicles, like buses
    and trams. This allows lights to change to allow traffic to flow through such
    that ambulances and buses will be able to move through the intersection quickly,
    which could help ambulances respond to calls faster and for buses to get people
    to their destinations quicker. This is particularly effective when coupled with
    bus/emergency vehicle lanes. There is a similar solution in which intersection
    cameras can detect bikes and pedestrians at an intersection, and give them priority,
    allowing them to pass through intersections more quickly.
	Moving to public transportation networks in a broader sense, there are technologies
    deployed in cities to help manage the flow of passengers through the network.
    Similar to technologies for intersections, camera can be placed at stops and
    in stations to monitor how many people are waiting for a particular route,
    and can adjust routes based on that information. For example, if there are
    a lot of people waiting on one line, the system can automatically add more
    trains or buses. If there are a lot of people at one particular stop, the
    system can send trains or buses directly to that stop, bypassing prior stops.
    This technology can be coupled with road technology for buses, so that if there
    is an accident along a bus route, all buses will be rerouted around it to make better time.
	Looking even further ahead, the advent of self driving cars will allow for
    more customized door to door transport. Similar to current ride sharing services,
    self driving cars can be used to request a ride to a particular destination,
    and would provide door to door service. However, self driving car technology
    would be cheaper for consumers, and allow for significantly more optimization
    of traffic flow, as cars would be redirected if there is traffic,
    and intersections can be more precisely timed.
